# Validation in Universal WIndows Platform

In Windows UWP XAML/C# apps, developers will discover that input controls do not support `DataAnnotation` or `ExceptionValidationRule` or `IDataErrorInfo` or `INotifyDataErrorInfo` or `BindingValidationError`. Even if the platform included these capabilities, there are significant limitations to each that make them a limiting option for application with significantreal-world data validation requirements. 

## Introducing Template10.Validation

These validation libraries provide UWP developers a comprehensive solution to data validation that solves problems in a realistic and usable way. The associated sample application demonstrates the use and syntax. If you have feedback or a bug to report, do it here: https://github.com/Windows-XAML/Template10/issues.
